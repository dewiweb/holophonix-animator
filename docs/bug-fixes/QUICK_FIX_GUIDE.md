# Animation Playback Fix

## Problem

After refactoring, animations were not playing - no movement in 3D preview and no OSC messages sent.

## Root Cause

The animation engine was missing the actual function call to calculate positions during the animation loop, even though the calculation functions were properly imported and available.

## Solution

### Fixed Animation Loop
The main fix was ensuring the `calculatePosition` function is actually called during animation frame updates:

```typescript
const updateFrame = (timestamp: number) => {
  if (!isPlaying || !activeAnimation) return;
  
  const elapsed = (timestamp - startTime) / 1000;
  const currentElapsed = elapsed % activeAnimation.duration;
  
  selectedTrackIds.forEach((trackId, index) => {
    const track = tracks.find(t => t.id === trackId);
    if (!track) return;
    
    // Calculate and apply new position
    const newPosition = calculatePosition(
      activeAnimation,
      currentElapsed,
      track,
      index,
      selectedTrackIds.length,
      multiTrackMode
    );
    
    // Update track and send OSC message
    projectStore.getState().updateTrackPosition(trackId, newPosition);
    if (oscStore.getState().isConnected) {
      oscStore.getState().sendPositionMessage(trackId, newPosition);
    }
  });
};
```

## Files Modified

- `src/stores/animationStore.ts` - Fixed animation loop
- `src/utils/animationCalculations.ts` - Position calculation functions
- `src/stores/projectStore.ts` - Track position updates
- `src/stores/oscStore.ts` - OSC message sending

## Results

After applying the fix:
- ✅ Animations play when clicking Play button
- ✅ Track positions update in real-time
- ✅ 3D preview shows movement
- ✅ OSC messages are sent at correct rate
- ✅ Animation timing is accurate
- ✅ Loop and ping-pong modes work

**Status**: ✅ Fixed  
**Impact**: Critical - animations were completely broken  
**Testing**: Verified with circular, linear, and random animations
