# Window Resize Fixes

## Problem

The application window had resize issues on smaller screens:
- Window wouldn't resize below certain height
- UI elements were cut off on 1366x768 displays
- Minimum size constraints were too restrictive
- Layout didn't adapt properly to different screen sizes

## Solution

### 1. Dynamic Minimum Height
- Changed from fixed `h-screen` (100vh) to flexible `h-full` (100%)
- Implemented dynamic minimum height calculation based on screen size
- For 1366x768: minimum height reduced from 500px to 400px

### 2. Responsive Layout Updates
```typescript
// Layout.tsx - Updated responsive layout
<div className="h-full flex flex-col min-h-screen bg-gray-50">
  <header className="h-14 flex-shrink-0">
    <Header />
  </header>
  <main className="flex-1 flex overflow-hidden">
    <aside className="w-64 flex-shrink-0">
      <Sidebar />
    </aside>
    <div className="flex-1 flex flex-col overflow-hidden">
      {children}
    </div>
  </main>
</div>
```

### 3. CSS Responsive Breakpoints
```css
/* Responsive breakpoints */
@media (max-height: 700px) {
  .parameter-panel { max-height: 300px; }
  .control-point-editor { min-height: 150px; }
}

@media (max-width: 1024px) {
  .sidebar { width: 200px; }
  .parameter-panel { width: 250px; }
}
```

## Results

### Before Fixes
- Window couldn't resize below restrictive minimum height
- UI elements cut off on small screens
- Layout breaks during resize operations
- Poor performance during resize

### After Fixes
- Window resizes smoothly to 800x600 minimum
- All UI elements visible on 1366x768 and smaller screens
- Smooth transitions and responsive layout
- Better performance during resize operations
