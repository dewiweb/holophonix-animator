```typescript
type EasingFunction = 
  | 'linear'
  | 'ease-in' | 'ease-out' | 'ease-in-out'
  | 'cubic-bezier'
  | 'bounce' | 'elastic' | 'back'
  | 'custom'; // User-defined functions
```

#### Animation Templates
- Pre-built animation sequences
- Template library with categories
- Custom template creation
- Template sharing and import/export

### Phase 2: Enhanced OSC Features

#### Custom OSC Endpoints
```typescript
interface CustomOSCEndpoint {
  id: string;

  address: string;
  messageFormat: OSCMessageFormat;
  mapping: ParameterMapping;
}
```

**Capabilities:**
- User-defined OSC message patterns
- Parameter mapping and transformation
- Conditional message sending
- OSC message templates and presets
