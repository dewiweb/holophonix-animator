# Control Point Editor Enhancements

## Overview

Enhanced the Control Point Editor with two critical usability improvements for precise animation editing:

1. **Overlapping Point Cycling** - Easy selection of stacked points
2. **Multi-Point Dragging** - Move multiple points simultaneously

---

## Feature 1: Overlapping Point Cycling

### Problem
When control points overlap in 3D space, users couldn't easily select or edit the underlying points.

### Solution
Added **cycling selection** with visual feedback:

```typescript
// Cycle through overlapping points on click
function cycleOverlappingPoints(clickedPoint: ControlPoint) {
  const overlappingPoints = findOverlappingPoints(clickedPoint);
  const currentIndex = overlappingPoints.indexOf(clickedPoint);
  const nextIndex = (currentIndex + 1) % overlappingPoints.length;
  
  selectPoint(overlappingPoints[nextIndex]);
  highlightSelectedPoint();
}
```

### Implementation Details
- **Detection**: Spatial proximity checking within 0.1 units
- **Cycling**: Click overlapping area to cycle through points
- **Visual feedback**: Selected point highlighted with distinct color
- **Keyboard support**: Tab key also cycles through overlapping points

### UI Enhancements
- **Selection indicator**: Bright yellow outline for selected point
- **Hover states**: Blue highlight on hover
- **Z-order management**: Selected point renders on top
- **Tooltip**: Shows point type and coordinates on hover

---

## Feature 2: Multi-Point Dragging

### Problem
Users needed to adjust multiple control points simultaneously for complex animation paths.

### Solution
Added **multi-select and drag** functionality:

```typescript
// Multi-point selection with Ctrl+Click
function handlePointClick(point: ControlPoint, event: MouseEvent) {
  if (event.ctrlKey) {
    togglePointSelection(point);
  } else {
    selectSinglePoint(point);
  }
}

// Drag all selected points together
function handleDrag(delta: Position) {
  selectedPoints.forEach(point => {
    point.position = {
      x: point.position.x + delta.x,
      y: point.position.y + delta.y,
      z: point.position.z + delta.z
    };
  });
  updateAnimationPath();
}
```

### Implementation Details
- **Selection methods**: 
  - Single click: Select single point
  - Ctrl+Click: Toggle selection
  - Shift+Drag: Box selection
  - Ctrl+A: Select all points
- **Drag behavior**: All selected points move together
- **Constraint options**: 
  - Free movement (default)
  - Axis-constrained (X, Y, or Z only)
  - Plane-constrained (XY, XZ, or YZ only)

### UI Enhancements
- **Selection box**: Visual rectangle for box selection
- **Multi-select indicators**: All selected points highlighted
- **Drag preview**: Ghost points show movement preview
- **Constraint controls**: Toolbar buttons for movement constraints

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:
- `ControlPointEditor.tsx` - Main component with new features
- `AnimationEditor.tsx` - Integration with multi-select state
- `types/index.ts` - Added selection state types
- `utils/geometry.ts` - Spatial proximity calculations

### Key Classes:

#### PointSelector
```typescript
class PointSelector {
  private selectedPoints: Set<string> = new Set();
  
  selectPoint(pointId: string, multiSelect: boolean = false) {
    if (!multiSelect) {
      this.selectedPoints.clear();
    }
    this.selectedPoints.add(pointId);
  }
  
  findOverlappingPoints(point: ControlPoint): ControlPoint[] {
    return this.allPoints.filter(p => 
      this.calculateDistance(p.position, point.position) < 0.1
    );
  }
}
```

#### DragHandler
```typescript
class DragHandler {
  private dragStart: Position;
  private selectedOffsets: Map<string, Position> = new Map();
  
  startDrag(points: ControlPoint[], startPosition: Position) {
    this.dragStart = startPosition;
    points.forEach(point => {
      this.selectedOffsets.set(point.id, {
        x: point.position.x - startPosition.x,
        y: point.position.y - startPosition.y,
        z: point.position.z - startPosition.z
      });
    });
  }
  
  updateDrag(currentPosition: Position, constraint?: AxisConstraint) {
    const delta = this.calculateDelta(currentPosition, constraint);
    this.applyDeltaToSelectedPoints(delta);
  }
}
```

## User Experience Improvements

### Workflow Enhancements
1. **Precise selection**: Cycle through overlapping points without frustration
2. **Bulk editing**: Select and move multiple points in one operation
3. **Constraint editing**: Constrain movement to specific axes or planes
4. **Visual feedback**: Clear indication of selection and drag state

### Performance Optimizations
- **Spatial indexing**: Quadtree for fast overlap detection
- **Batch updates**: Group position updates to reduce recalculations
- **Lazy rendering**: Only update visible control points
- **Memory management**: Efficient selection state tracking

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Click` | Select single point |
| `Ctrl+Click` | Toggle multi-select |
| `Shift+Drag` | Box selection |
| `Ctrl+A` | Select all points |
| `Escape` | Clear selection |
| `Tab` | Cycle overlapping points |
| `Delete` | Delete selected points |
| `G` | Toggle grid snap |
| `X/Y/Z` | Constrain to axis |

## Testing Scenarios

### 1. Overlapping Point Cycling
1. Create multiple control points at same location
2. Click on overlapping area
3. Verify selection cycles through all points
4. Verify visual feedback shows correct selection

### 2. Multi-Point Dragging
1. Select multiple points with Ctrl+Click
2. Drag one selected point
3. Verify all selected points move together
4. Test axis constraints with X/Y/Z keys

### 3. Performance Testing
1. Create 100+ control points
2. Select all points (Ctrl+A)
3. Drag selection around
4. Verify smooth 60 FPS performance
