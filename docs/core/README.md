# Core Concepts

This section covers the fundamental concepts and components that make up the Holophonix Animator. Understanding these concepts is essential for any developer working on the project.

## Key Concepts

1. [Coordinate Systems](coordinate-system.md)
   - Understanding AED (Azimuth, Elevation, Distance) and XYZ coordinate systems
   - Coordinate system conversions
   - Relative vs. absolute positioning

2. [Motion Models](motion-models.md)
   - Basic motion types
   - Complex motion patterns
   - Interpolation methods
   - Time-based animations

3. [OSC Protocol](osc-protocol.md)
   - OSC message format
   - Communication patterns
   - State synchronization
   - Error handling

4. [Behaviors](behaviors.md)
   - Behavior system architecture
   - Built-in behaviors
   - Custom behavior development
   - Behavior composition

## Getting Started

If you're new to the project, we recommend reading these documents in the following order:

1. Start with [Coordinate Systems](coordinate-system.md) to understand the spatial fundamentals
2. Move on to [Motion Models](motion-models.md) to learn how we handle animations
3. Read about [Behaviors](behaviors.md) to understand how we compose complex movements
4. Finally, dive into the [OSC Protocol](osc-protocol.md) to understand how we communicate with Holophonix systems

## Implementation Details

For detailed implementation information, refer to the [Implementation Guide](../implementation/README.md) section, which covers how these concepts are implemented in the codebase.
