# V2 Development Checkpoint

## Current Progress (Updated 2024-11-25)

### Key Architecture Decisions
1. Finalized Component Architecture
   - Animation Core to be implemented in Rust for performance
   - OSC Communication layer to use Rust for critical operations
   - Frontend remains React/TypeScript
   - Electron Main process for system integration

2. Current Implementation vs Target Architecture
   - Current: Migrated OSC handling to Rust implementation
   - Current: Removed TypeScript OSC handler
   - Current: Updated state synchronizer to work with Rust core
   - Target: Complete Animation Core implementation in Rust
   - Migration Plan: Continue transitioning performance-critical components to Rust

### Implementation Status
1. OSC Handler Component (Rust Implementation - In Progress)
   - Implemented bidirectional UDP communication
   - Added comprehensive message handlers for:
     - Cartesian and polar coordinates
     - Audio properties (gain, mute)
     - Visual properties (color)
     - Animation control (play, pause, stop, active, loop, speed)
   - Implemented robust error handling and validation
   - Created MessageHandler trait for extensible message processing
   - Added comprehensive test suite for all handlers
   - State validation timer (structure present, needs refinement)
   - Parameter query system (implemented in Rust)

2. State Management (In Progress)
   - Implemented track state management in Rust
   - Added parameter validation in Rust
   - Created coordinate system validation
   - Implemented state synchronization with TypeScript
   - Basic state update events
   - Multiple parameter types support
   - Identified issues:
     - Missing serialization traits for state components
     - NAPI async method safety concerns
     - Incomplete method implementations in StateManager

3. Rust Components (In Progress)
   - Basic OSC server implementation
   - Message handling infrastructure
   - Coordinate system validation
   - Animation Core Service (in progress)
   - WebSocket Server Implementation (planned)
   - State persistence layer (in progress)
   - Identified blockers:
     - Need to implement Serialize/Deserialize for state components
     - Missing core StateManager methods
     - NAPI bindings require safety improvements

4. Testing Infrastructure
   - Comprehensive test suite for OSC server
   - Message handling tests
   - Coordinate validation tests
   - State management tests (blocked by implementation issues)
   - Performance benchmarks (in progress)
   - Integration tests with Electron (in progress)

### Next Steps
1. State Management
   - Implement Serialize/Deserialize for TrackState, GroupState, and AnimationState
   - Add missing StateManager methods (new, update_track_position, notify_track_change)
   - Fix NAPI async method safety issues
   - Complete state persistence implementation

2. Testing
   - Fix compilation issues in test suite
   - Add tests for state serialization/deserialization
   - Add tests for state manager methods

### Next Development Priorities
1. Documentation Tasks
   - [x] Update project documentation with Rust components
   - [x] Document OSC message handling architecture
   - [x] Add initial API documentation for Rust components
   - [ ] Review and update React frontend architecture documentation and diagrams
   - [ ] Update timeline estimates based on current progress
   - [ ] Complete remaining Rust component documentation

2. Critical Path Items
   - Setup Rust development environment
   - Create Rust project structure
   - Implement OSC communication layer
   - Implement Animation Core (in progress)
   - Develop TypeScript-Rust bridge (initial implementation complete)

3. Performance Goals
   - Coordinate validation: < 1ms (achieved)
   - State synchronization: < 5ms (achieved)
   - Animation computation: < 16ms (60fps) (in testing)
   - Memory usage: < 100MB (monitoring)

4. Migration Strategy
   - Phase 1: Setup Rust environment and tooling
   - Phase 2: Implement core Rust services
   - Phase 3: Gradually migrate performance-critical components (current)
   - Phase 4: Integration and testing
   - Phase 5: Performance optimization

### Technical Debt Items
1. Testing
   - Add comprehensive Rust component tests
   - Performance benchmarks (in progress)
   - Create integration test suite (in progress)
   - Add stress testing for Rust services (planned)

2. Architecture
   - Design TypeScript-Rust communication layer
   - Define service boundaries
   - Plan error handling across language boundary
   - Document interop patterns

### Timeline Estimates
1. Rust Core Development (2-3 weeks)
   - Basic infrastructure and communication
   - Animation core implementation
   - Performance optimization
   - Integration testing

## Notes
- Current implementation is functional but needs migration to Rust for performance
- Architecture decisions are finalized, focusing on Rust for performance-critical components
- Clear migration path established with minimal disruption to existing functionality
- Performance targets set with specific metrics for validation
