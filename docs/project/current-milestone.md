# V2 Development Checkpoint

## Current Progress (Updated 2024-01-09)

### Key Architecture Decisions
1. Finalized Component Architecture
   - Animation Core to be implemented in Rust for performance
   - OSC Communication layer to use Rust for critical operations
   - Frontend remains React/TypeScript
   - Electron Main process for system integration

2. Current Implementation vs Target Architecture
   - Current: TypeScript-based implementation of Animation Core
   - Target: Rust-based high-performance computation engine
   - Migration Plan: Gradual transition of performance-critical components to Rust

### Implementation Status
1. OSC Handler Component (Rust Implementation - In Progress)
   - Implemented bidirectional UDP communication
   - Added comprehensive message handlers for:
     - Cartesian and polar coordinates
     - Audio properties (gain, mute)
     - Visual properties (color)
     - Animation control (play, pause, stop, active, loop, speed)
   - Implemented robust error handling and validation
   - Created MessageHandler trait for extensible message processing
   - Added comprehensive test suite for all handlers
   - State validation timer (structure present, needs refinement)
   - Parameter query system (to be migrated)

2. State Management (Partially Complete)
   - Implemented track state management in Rust
   - Added parameter validation in Rust
   - Created coordinate system validation
   - Implemented state synchronization
   - Basic state update events
   - Multiple parameter types support

3. Rust Components (In Progress)
   - Basic OSC server implementation
   - Message handling infrastructure
   - Coordinate system validation
   - Animation Core Service (not started)
   - WebSocket Server Implementation (not started)

4. Testing Infrastructure
   - Comprehensive test suite for OSC server
   - Message handling tests
   - Coordinate validation tests
   - State management tests
   - Performance benchmarks (pending)
   - Integration tests with Electron (pending)

### Next Development Priorities
1. Documentation Tasks
   - [x] Update project documentation with Rust components
   - [ ] Review and update React frontend architecture documentation and diagrams
   - [ ] Document OSC message handling architecture
   - [ ] Add API documentation for Rust components
   - [ ] Update timeline estimates based on current progress
   - [ ] Document new Rust component integration

2. Critical Path Items
   - Setup Rust development environment
   - Create Rust project structure
   - Implement OSC communication layer
   - Implement Animation Core
   - Develop TypeScript-Rust bridge

3. Performance Goals
   - Coordinate validation: < 1ms
   - State synchronization: < 5ms
   - Animation computation: < 16ms (60fps)
   - Memory usage: < 100MB

4. Migration Strategy
   - Phase 1: Setup Rust environment and tooling
   - Phase 2: Implement core Rust services
   - Phase 3: Gradually migrate performance-critical components
   - Phase 4: Integration and testing
   - Phase 5: Performance optimization

### Technical Debt Items
1. Testing
   - Add comprehensive Rust component tests
   - Implement performance benchmarks
   - Create integration test suite
   - Add stress testing for Rust services

2. Architecture
   - Design TypeScript-Rust communication layer
   - Define service boundaries
   - Plan error handling across language boundary
   - Document interop patterns

### Timeline Estimates
1. Rust Setup (1-2 weeks)
   - Development environment
   - Project structure
   - Basic tooling

2. Core Implementation (4-6 weeks)
   - Animation Core service
   - Coordinate validation
   - Performance optimization
   - Integration with TypeScript

3. Migration (4-6 weeks)
   - Gradual component migration
   - Testing and validation
   - Performance tuning
   - Documentation

## Notes
- Current implementation is functional but needs migration to Rust for performance
- Architecture decisions are finalized, focusing on Rust for performance-critical components
- Clear migration path established with minimal disruption to existing functionality
- Performance targets set with specific metrics for validation
