# Test-Driven Development Plan

## Overview

This document outlines our transition to a Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology for the Holophonix Animator project. The plan covers all major components and establishes guidelines for writing and maintaining tests.

## Current Test Coverage

### Existing Tests
- Shared Services:
  - StateSynchronizer (Unit + Integration tests)
  - Coordinate Validator (Unit tests)

### Test Infrastructure
- Jest for JavaScript/TypeScript testing
- Rust's built-in testing framework for Rust components
- Coverage requirements: 80% for branches, functions, lines, and statements

## TDD Implementation Plan

### 1. Core Components Testing

#### 1.1 Rust Core (Priority: High)
- Animation Engine
  - Unit tests for each animation model
  - Property-based testing for interpolation functions
  - Integration tests for the complete animation pipeline
  - Performance benchmarks for critical paths

- State Manager
  - Unit tests for state transitions
  - Concurrent operation tests
  - Error handling scenarios
  - State synchronization edge cases

#### 1.2 OSC Communication (Priority: High)
- Protocol Implementation
  - Message parsing/formatting
  - Error handling
  - Connection management
  - Timeout scenarios
  - Malformed message handling

- Integration Tests
  - End-to-end communication flow
  - Network error scenarios
  - State synchronization
  - Performance under load

### 2. Frontend Testing

#### 2.1 React Components (Priority: Medium)
- Unit Tests
  - Individual component rendering
  - State management
  - Event handling
  - Props validation

- Integration Tests
  - Component interaction
  - State propagation
  - User interaction flows
  - Error boundary testing

#### 2.2 Electron Integration (Priority: Medium)
- IPC Communication
  - Message passing
  - Error handling
  - State synchronization

- Main Process
  - Window management
  - App lifecycle
  - System integration

### 3. Testing Guidelines

#### 3.1 Test Structure
```typescript
describe('Component/Feature', () => {
  // Setup
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Common setup
  });

  describe('Functionality', () => {
    it('should behave as expected under normal conditions', () => {
      // Arrange
      // Act
      // Assert
    });

    it('should handle error conditions appropriately', () => {
      // Error scenarios
    });
  });
});
```

#### 3.2 Best Practices
1. Write tests before implementation (TDD)
2. One assertion per test
3. Clear test descriptions
4. Proper setup and teardown
5. Mock external dependencies
6. Test edge cases
7. Maintain test isolation

### 4. Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
- Set up testing infrastructure
- Create test templates
- Write initial test suites for core functionality

#### Phase 2: Core Components (Week 3-4)
- Implement Rust core tests
- Add OSC communication tests
- Establish CI/CD pipeline for tests

#### Phase 3: Frontend (Week 5-6)
- Add React component tests
- Implement Electron integration tests
- Set up E2E testing framework

#### Phase 4: Integration (Week 7-8)
- Add cross-component integration tests
- Implement performance tests
- Set up monitoring and reporting

### 5. Continuous Integration

- Run tests on every PR
- Maintain coverage thresholds
- Automated test reporting
- Performance regression testing

### 6. Maintenance

- Regular test review sessions
- Update tests with new features
- Refactor tests for maintainability
- Document test patterns and examples

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve test plan
2. Set up additional testing infrastructure
3. Begin implementing Phase 1
4. Schedule regular progress reviews

## Success Metrics

- Test coverage >= 80%
- All new features accompanied by tests
- Reduced bug reports in production
- Faster development cycles
- Improved code maintainability
