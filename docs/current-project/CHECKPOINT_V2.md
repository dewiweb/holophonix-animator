# V2 Development Checkpoint

## Current Progress (Updated 2024-01-09)

### Key Architecture Decisions
1. Finalized Component Architecture
   - Animation Core to be implemented in Rust for performance
   - OSC Communication layer to use Rust for critical operations
   - Frontend remains React/TypeScript
   - Electron Main process for system integration

2. Current Implementation vs Target Architecture
   - Current: TypeScript-based implementation of Animation Core
   - Target: Rust-based high-performance computation engine
   - Migration Plan: Gradual transition of performance-critical components to Rust

### Implementation Status
1. OSC Handler Component (Temporary TypeScript Implementation)
   - Implemented bidirectional UDP communication
   - Added basic connection monitoring
   - Added basic retry logic
   - Batch operations with size limits and rate limiting
   - Error handling (basic implementation, needs expansion)
   - State validation timer (structure present, needs refinement)
   - Added parameter query system
   - Color handling support
   - Coordinate system support

2. State Management (Partially Complete)
   - Implemented basic track state tracking via Map
   - Parameter validation (needs migration to Rust)
   - State synchronization (basic implementation)
   - State caching via Map structure
   - Basic state update events
   - Multiple parameter types support

3. Rust Components (Not Started)
   - Animation Core Service
   - Coordinate System Validation
   - Performance-critical Operations
   - WebSocket Server Implementation
   - UDP Communication Layer

4. Testing Infrastructure
   - Basic test suite structure
   - Connection tests (partial coverage)
   - Message handling tests
   - State update tests
   - Performance benchmarks for Rust components
   - Integration tests with Rust services

### Next Development Priorities
1. Critical Path Items
   - Setup Rust development environment
   - Create Rust project structure
   - Implement basic Rust-based Animation Core
   - Develop TypeScript-Rust bridge
   - Port coordinate validation to Rust

2. Performance Goals
   - Coordinate validation: < 1ms
   - State synchronization: < 5ms
   - Animation computation: < 16ms (60fps)
   - Memory usage: < 100MB

3. Migration Strategy
   - Phase 1: Setup Rust environment and tooling
   - Phase 2: Implement core Rust services
   - Phase 3: Gradually migrate performance-critical components
   - Phase 4: Integration and testing
   - Phase 5: Performance optimization

### Technical Debt Items
1. Testing
   - Add comprehensive Rust component tests
   - Implement performance benchmarks
   - Create integration test suite
   - Add stress testing for Rust services

2. Architecture
   - Design TypeScript-Rust communication layer
   - Define service boundaries
   - Plan error handling across language boundary
   - Document interop patterns

### Timeline Estimates
1. Rust Setup (1-2 weeks)
   - Development environment
   - Project structure
   - Basic tooling

2. Core Implementation (4-6 weeks)
   - Animation Core service
   - Coordinate validation
   - Performance optimization
   - Integration with TypeScript

3. Migration (4-6 weeks)
   - Gradual component migration
   - Testing and validation
   - Performance tuning
   - Documentation

## Notes
- Current implementation is functional but needs migration to Rust for performance
- Architecture decisions are finalized, focusing on Rust for performance-critical components
- Clear migration path established with minimal disruption to existing functionality
- Performance targets set with specific metrics for validation
