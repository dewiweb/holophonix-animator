# Native Bridge (N-API)

## Overview

The Native Bridge component provides the interface between our Rust core and Node.js/Electron layers using N-API. This bridge enables efficient, type-safe communication while maintaining memory safety and performance.

## Architecture

### N-API Bindings
- Type-safe function exports
- Asynchronous operation support
- Memory management and garbage collection
- Error handling and propagation

### Data Marshalling
- Zero-copy where possible
- Efficient type conversion
- Buffer management
- Structured data handling

### Callback System
- Event registration
- Asynchronous notifications
- State change propagation
- Error callbacks

## Implementation Details

### Synchronous Operations
- Direct function calls for:
  - State queries
  - Configuration updates
  - Track property updates
  - Group management operations
- Immediate results with type safety
- Critical path optimizations
- Connection state queries

### Asynchronous Operations
- Animation frame updates
- OSC message handling
- State synchronization
- Performance metrics collection
- Resource-intensive computations
- Background tasks:
  - Auto-save operations
  - Connection monitoring
  - Error recovery

### Error Handling
- Type-safe error propagation
- Detailed error information:
  - Error codes
  - Stack traces
  - Context information
- Recovery mechanisms:
  - Automatic retry logic
  - Fallback strategies
  - State recovery
- Debug information for development

For details on how these operations are reflected in the UI, see [Frontend Architecture](../../react/frontend-architecture.md).
For information about state management, see [State Management](../../rust-core/state-manager/state-management.md).

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Management
- Efficient resource cleanup
- Garbage collection integration
- Buffer pooling
- Reference counting

### Threading
- Thread safety
- Worker threads
- Event loop integration
- Lock-free operations where possible

## Integration Points

### Electron Integration
- Main process communication
- IPC bridge
- Window management
- System integration

### Rust Core Integration
- State management
- Animation engine
- OSC communication
- Configuration handling
