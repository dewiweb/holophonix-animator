# Holophonix Animator Target Architecture

This document outlines the target architecture we want to achieve for the Holophonix Animator application. It serves as a working document to define and refine the architectural needs of the project.

## Target Architecture Diagram

The architecture diagram is available in the following formats:

## Areas to Define and Refine

1. **Animation Service Architecture**
   - [ ] Choose optimal programming language (Rust/C++)
   - [ ] Define service communication protocol (WebSocket/gRPC)
   - [ ] Design computation modules interfaces
   - [ ] Specify performance requirements
   - [ ] Plan scaling strategy

2. **External Systems Integration**
   - [ ] Define exact OSC protocol requirements
   - [ ] Specify any additional external systems needed
   - [ ] Plan communication between Animation Service and Holophonix

3. **Main Process Architecture**
   - [ ] Design Animation Bridge implementation
   - [ ] Define service client requirements
   - [ ] Plan error handling and recovery strategies

4. **Data Flow**
   - [ ] Define data models for animation calculations
   - [ ] Specify state update patterns
   - [ ] Design high-performance data exchange format

5. **Performance Requirements**
   - [ ] Define computation performance targets
   - [ ] Specify maximum latency requirements
   - [ ] Plan resource allocation strategy
   - [ ] Define scaling limits

## Notes and Decisions

1. **Architecture Decisions**:
   - Separate Animation Core into dedicated high-performance service
   - Use WebSocket/gRPC for efficient service communication
   - Implement modular computation system

2. **Technology Considerations**:
   - Rust/C++ for performance-critical calculations
   - Binary protocol for minimal communication overhead
   - Potential for distributed computation

3. **Open Questions**:
   - Service deployment strategy
   - Inter-process communication optimization
   - State synchronization approach
   - Error recovery mechanisms
