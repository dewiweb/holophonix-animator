# Component Architecture

## Overview

The Holophonix Animator is built with a modular component architecture that separates concerns and promotes maintainability.

## Core Components

### 1. OSC Communication Layer (Rust)
- UDP socket management and real-time message handling
- OSC message parsing and validation
- Efficient message queuing and processing
- Concurrent connection handling for Holophonix and external control
- Zero-cost abstractions for optimal performance
- Type-safe message handling

### 2. Animation Core (Rust)
- High-performance computation engine
- Motion model processing
- Real-time parameter calculations
- State management core
- Direct integration with OSC layer

### 3. Rust-Node Bridge
- Native Node module compiled from Rust
- N-API bindings for safe FFI
- Synchronous operations for critical paths
- Asynchronous operations for long-running tasks
- Error propagation across language boundary
- Zero-copy data transfer where possible

### 4. Electron Main Process
- Loads and initializes native Rust module
- Manages native module lifecycle
- Handles system events
- Configuration management
- Window management
- IPC with renderer process

### 5. Frontend (React/TypeScript)
- User interface components
- State visualization
- User input handling
- Real-time feedback

## Component Interactions

### Data Flow
1. User Interface → Electron Main
   - User inputs are captured
   - Commands are pre-validated
   - Events are forwarded to Rust

2. Electron Main → Rust Core
   - Direct function calls through N-API
   - Async operations via promises
   - Structured data exchange
   - Error handling across boundary

3. Rust Core (Animation + OSC)
   - Commands processed in Animation Core
   - State changes computed
   - OSC messages generated and sent
   - Incoming messages parsed and processed
   - Real-time performance monitoring

4. Rust → Electron → UI
   - State updates via callback functions
   - Events propagated through IPC
   - Error states handled

## Performance Considerations

### Native Module Integration
- Direct memory access between Node and Rust
- Minimal serialization overhead
- Efficient thread management
- Proper resource cleanup

### OSC Communication (Rust)
- Zero-copy message parsing
- Lock-free concurrent processing
- Minimal latency for real-time control
- Efficient memory management
- Predictable performance characteristics

### State Management
- State updates handled in Rust
- Minimal copying between components
- Efficient serialization for IPC
- Optimized update propagation

## Error Handling

### Native Module Errors
- Proper error types in Rust
- Error conversion to JavaScript
- Stack traces preserved
- Memory safety maintained

### Network Errors
- Handled at Rust level
- Propagated through error channels
- Automatic recovery where possible
- Clear error reporting to UI

### State Errors
- Validation in Rust core
- Type-safe state transitions
- Consistent error propagation
- Recovery mechanisms

## Development Considerations

### Build Process
- Native module compilation
- Platform-specific binaries
- Development hot-reload support
- Production optimization

### Debugging
- Native module debugging
- Cross-language stack traces
- Performance profiling
- Memory leak detection
