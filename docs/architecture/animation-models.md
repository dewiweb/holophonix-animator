# Animation Models Architecture

## Overview

Animation Models form the core behavioral components of the Holophonix Animator. Each model defines specific movement patterns and behaviors for spatial audio positioning, with precise mathematical foundations and configurable parameters. Models can be applied to both individual tracks and track groups, with behavior determined by track relationships and coordinate system constraints.
