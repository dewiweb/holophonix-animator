### Implementation Status
1. ✅ OSC Handler Component
   - Implemented bidirectional UDP communication
   - Added connection monitoring with timeouts
   - Added retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Implemented batch operations with size limits
   - Added comprehensive error handling
   - Added state validation timer
   - Added parameter query system
   - Added color handling support
   - Added support for both cartesian and polar coordinates

2. ✅ State Management
   - Implemented track state tracking
   - Added parameter validation
   - Added state synchronization
   - Added state caching
   - Added state update events
   - Added support for multiple parameter types

3. ✅ Testing Infrastructure
   - Added comprehensive test suite
   - Added connection tests
   - Added message handling tests
   - Added state update tests
   - Added timeout tests
   - Added error handling tests
   - Added mock UDP port for testing

4. ✅ Performance & Reliability
   - Added benchmarking module
   - Implemented retry logic
   - Added validation timer
   - Added proper resource cleanup
   - Added connection timeout handling
   - Added query timeout handling

5. ✅ Type Safety
   - Added comprehensive type definitions
   - Added message type validation
   - Added parameter type checking
   - Added error type system
   - Added state update type validation

### Configuration Details
1. OSC Handler
   - Default port: 4003
   - Connection timeout: 5s
   - Query timeout: 1s
   - Validation interval: 5s
   - Max retries: 3
   - Max batch size: 10

2. State Manager
   - Track state caching
   - Parameter validation
   - State change events
   - Error recovery
   - Batch update optimization

### Completed Tasks
1. ✅ Implemented OSC Handler with timeout/retry logic
2. ✅ Developed State Manager with parameter validation
3. ✅ Added connection monitoring with exponential backoff
4. ✅ Implemented batch update system with size limits
5. ✅ Created comprehensive error handling system
6. ✅ Added logging system for errors and state changes

### Resolved Questions
- Timeout values:
  - Connection: 5s
  - Query: 1s
  - Validation: 5s
- Retry counts:
  - Connection: 3 attempts
  - Message send: 3 attempts
- Critical parameters:
  - Position (xyz, aed)
  - Gain
  - Mute
  - Color
- Batch size limit: 10 parameters
- Error recovery:
  - Connection errors: Retry with backoff
  - Validation errors: Re-sync state
  - State sync errors: Query specific parameters

### Next Steps
1. [ ] Integrate OSC Handler with main application
2. [ ] Add UI components for state visualization
3. [ ] Implement user interaction handlers
4. [ ] Add state persistence
5. [ ] Add configuration UI
6. [ ] Add performance monitoring UI

### Open Questions
- UI/UX design for state visualization
- User interaction patterns
- State persistence format
- Configuration UI layout
- Performance metrics to display

## Implementation Details
- OSC Handler implemented in TypeScript
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Event-based architecture
- Type-safe message handling
- Efficient state management
- Proper error handling and recovery
