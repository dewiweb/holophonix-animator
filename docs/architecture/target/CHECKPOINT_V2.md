### Configuration Details
1. OSC Handler
   - Output port: 4003 (Holophonix Designer)
   - Input port: 1234 (Local listening)
   - Connection timeout: 30s
   - Cleanup timeout: 5s
   - Max retries: Configurable
   - Proper port cleanup on close

2. Message Handling
   - Support for single messages and bundles
   - Proper event emission
   - Detailed logging
   - Error handling with retries
   - Connection state tracking

### Completed Tasks
1. ✅ Implemented OSC Handler with proper event handling
2. ✅ Added connection state management
3. ✅ Added message and bundle event handlers
4. ✅ Created comprehensive error handling system
5. ✅ Added proper cleanup procedures
6. ✅ Added detailed logging system
7. ✅ Implemented proper message format validation
8. ✅ Added comprehensive test suite
9. ✅ Updated documentation with message handling details

### Resolved Questions
- Timeout values:
  - Connection: 30s
  - Cleanup: 5s
- Message formats:
  - Query: `/get /track/{id}/...`
  - Set: `/track/{id}/... {value}`
  - Response: Same as query path
- Critical parameters:
  - Position (xyz, aed)
  - Gain
  - Mute
  - Color
- Error handling:
  - Connection errors: Retry with backoff
  - Port errors: Proper cleanup
  - Message errors: Logging and retry

### Next Steps
1. [ ] Integrate OSC Handler with main application
2. [ ] Add UI components for connection state
3. [ ] Implement parameter control UI
4. [ ] Add connection configuration UI
5. [ ] Add message monitoring UI
6. [ ] Implement external control interface
7. [ ] Add state persistence
8. [ ] Add performance monitoring

### Open Questions
- UI/UX design for connection management
- Parameter control interface design
- Message monitoring visualization
- State persistence format
- Performance metrics to track
- External control message format

## Implementation Details
- OSC Handler implemented in TypeScript
- Event-based architecture
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Type-safe message handling
- Proper error handling and recovery
- Detailed logging for debugging
- Clean resource management
