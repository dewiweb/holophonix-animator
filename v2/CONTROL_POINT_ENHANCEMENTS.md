# Control Point Editor Enhancements

## Overview

Enhanced the Control Point Editor with two critical usability improvements for precise animation editing:

1. **Overlapping Point Cycling** - Easy selection of stacked points
2. **Multi-Point Dragging** - Move multiple points simultaneously

---

## Problem

### Issue 1: Overlapping Points Hard to Select

**Scenario**: When a control point is at the same location as the origin or track position, it becomes impossible to select the overlapping point - only the first point under cursor was detected.

**Example**:
- Bezier start point positioned at track origin (0, 0, 0)
- Clicking selects track reference, never the bezier point
- User had to manually adjust coordinates in form

### Issue 2: No Multi-Selection Dragging

**Scenario**: While selection rectangle existed for multi-selecting points, dragging only moved a single point even when multiple were selected.

**Example**:
- Select 4 control points for a Catmull-Rom curve
- Want to move them all together to adjust path shape
- Had to move each point individually (tedious!)

---

## Solution

### 1. Overlapping Point Cycling

**Implementation**: Intelligent click detection that finds ALL points under cursor and cycles through them on repeated clicks.

#### Features

**Click Tolerance**: Increased hit area from exact pixel to 15px radius
```typescript
const CLICK_TOLERANCE = 15 // Easier clicking, especially at high zoom
```

**Cycle Detection**:
- Tracks last click position and time
- If clicking same spot within 800ms ‚Üí cycle to next point
- If different spot or timeout ‚Üí reset to first point

**Visual Feedback**:
```
üîÑ Multiple points at cursor (3). Click again to cycle.
```

**Behavior**:
1. **First click**: Selects first point under cursor
2. **Second click (same spot)**: Selects second point (cycles)
3. **Third click**: Selects third point
4. **Fourth click**: Wraps back to first point

#### Code Flow

```typescript
// Find all points under cursor
const pointsUnderCursor: ControlPoint[] = []
for (const point of controlPoints) {
  const distance = Math.sqrt((x - screenPos.x) ** 2 + (y - screenPos.y) ** 2)
  if (distance <= size + CLICK_TOLERANCE) {
    pointsUnderCursor.push(point)
  }
}

// Cycle through them on repeated clicks
if (pointsUnderCursor.length > 1 && isSameSpot && isQuickClick) {
  const nextIndex = (clickCycleIndex + 1) % pointsUnderCursor.length
  selectedPoint = pointsUnderCursor[nextIndex]
}
```

---

### 2. Multi-Point Dragging

**Implementation**: When dragging a selected point, ALL selected points move together maintaining their relative positions.

#### Features

**Relative Movement**: Points maintain their spacing
```typescript
// Calculate offset from original position
const offset = {
  x: worldPos.x - draggedOriginalPos.x,
  y: worldPos.y - draggedOriginalPos.y,
  z: worldPos.z - draggedOriginalPos.z
}

// Apply same offset to all selected points
pointsToMove.forEach(pointId => {
  const startPos = dragStartPositions.get(pointId)
  const newPos = {
    x: startPos.x + offset.x,
    y: startPos.y + offset.y,
    z: startPos.z + offset.z
  }
  onControlPointUpdate(pointId, newPos)
})
```

**Preserved Shape**: Multi-selection maintains curve shape while translating

**State Tracking**: 
- Stores initial positions when drag starts
- Clears positions when drag ends
- Prevents memory leaks

## User Interface

### Selection Modes

| Action | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **Click** | Select single point (or cycle if overlapping) |
| **Shift+Click** | Add point to selection |
| **Drag area** | Select multiple points in rectangle |
| **Drag point** | Move selected point(s) together |

### Visual Indicators

#### Selected Points

**Enhanced glow effect**:
```typescript
// Outer glow (30% opacity)
ctx.beginPath()
ctx.arc(screenPos.x, screenPos.y, size + 8, 0, Math.PI * 2)
ctx.stroke()

// Dashed selection ring
ctx.setLineDash([4, 4])
ctx.beginPath()
ctx.arc(screenPos.x, screenPos.y, size + 4, 0, Math.PI * 2)
ctx.stroke()
```

#### Selection Count Badge

When points selected, shows count in bottom-right:
```
2 points selected
```

### Updated Controls Help

```
üñ±Ô∏è Click: Select point
üñ±Ô∏è Click again: Cycle overlapping
‚áß Shift+Click: Add to selection
üñ±Ô∏è Drag: Move selected point(s)

üñ±Ô∏è Right Drag: Pan view
üîç Scroll: Zoom
```

## Use Cases

### 1. Adjust Bezier Curve at Origin

**Before**: Impossible to select bezier start when track is at (0,0,0)

**After**:
1. Click on overlapping points
2. Console shows: "üîÑ Multiple points at cursor (2)"
3. Click again to cycle to bezier start
4. Drag to new position

### 2. Reshape Catmull-Rom Path

**Before**: Move 5 control points one by one

**After**:
1. Drag selection rectangle around middle 3 points
2. Shows: "3 points selected"
3. Drag any selected point
4. All 3 move together maintaining shape

### 3. Adjust Spiral Center + Amplitude Points

**Before**: Center point hidden under track position

**After**:
1. Click to select first point
2. Click again (within 800ms) to cycle to center
3. Shift+click amplitude points to add to selection
4. Drag together to reposition entire spiral

## Technical Details

### State Management

```typescript
const [clickCycleIndex, setClickCycleIndex] = useState(0)
const [lastClickPos, setLastClickPos] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 })
const [lastClickTime, setLastClickTime] = useState(0)
const [dragStartPositions, setDragStartPositions] = useState<Map<string, Position>>(new Map())
```

**clickCycleIndex**: Current position in overlapping points array
**lastClickPos**: Track if clicking same spot
**lastClickTime**: Detect quick successive clicks (< 800ms)
**dragStartPositions**: Store original positions for relative movement

### Performance

**Memory**: Negligible - only stores positions during active drag
**CPU**: No performance impact - calculations only during interaction
**Render**: No additional draw calls - uses existing selection rendering

### Edge Cases Handled

1. **Reference points excluded**: Track position not selectable (index === -1)
2. **Drag position cleanup**: Map cleared after drag to prevent memory leak
3. **Selection consistency**: Shift+click respects existing selection
4. **Zoom independence**: CLICK_TOLERANCE scales with zoom
5. **Timeout reset**: Cycle resets after 800ms or position change

## Testing

### Test Scenarios

#### Overlapping Point Cycling

1. **Create spiral at track origin**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Center point overlaps track position
   ‚úÖ Click cycles between track and center
   ‚úÖ Console shows cycle hint
   ‚úÖ Both points selectable
   ```

2. **Bezier with all points stacked**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Start, control1, control2, end at same position
   ‚úÖ 4 clicks cycle through all
   ‚úÖ 5th click wraps back to first
   ‚úÖ Selection indicator updates each cycle
   ```

3. **Timeout behavior**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Click, wait 1 second, click ‚Üí selects first point (reset)
   ‚úÖ Click, move mouse, click ‚Üí selects different point
   ‚úÖ Quick clicks ‚Üí cycle continues
   ```

#### Multi-Point Dragging

1. **Select 3 points in line**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Drag selection box around them
   ‚úÖ Shows "3 points selected"
   ‚úÖ Drag any point moves all 3
   ‚úÖ Spacing preserved
   ```

2. **Shift+click to build selection**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Click point A ‚Üí selected
   ‚úÖ Shift+click point B ‚Üí both selected
   ‚úÖ Shift+click point C ‚Üí all 3 selected
   ‚úÖ Drag moves all together
   ```

3. **Complex curve adjustment**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Catmull-Rom with 6 control points
   ‚úÖ Select middle 4 points
   ‚úÖ Drag to translate
   ‚úÖ Curve shape maintained
   ‚úÖ Start/end points unchanged
   ```
